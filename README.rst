Robust CouchDB Python interface using python-requests.

Goals:
 * Only one way to do something
 * Fast and stable (connection pooled)
 * Explicit is better than implicit. Buffer sizes, connection pool size.
 * Specify query parameters, no **params in query functions
 * Not configurable with multiple backends but one single well tested backend
 
Non-goals:
 * Full api coverage (In my view async support requires mainloop integration).
 
Plan to implement schema support in the future but right now it is not supported.
