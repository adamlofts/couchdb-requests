Extension to use couchdbkit in Django 1.x. It allows you to use couchdbkit
easily in your django projects.

Just add to your settings the `COUCHDB_DATABASES` that defines 

        COUCHDB_DATABASES = (
            ('djangoapp.greeting', 'http://127.0.0.1:5984/greeting'),
        )

This one define the db greeting on url `http://127.0.0.1:5984/greeting`
for the application `greeting`of djangoapp project.


Then add extension to your INSTALLED_APPS before all applications using
couchdbkit documents :

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ....
        'couchdbkit.ext.django',
        ....
    )

Add your documents objects in models.py : 

    from couchdbreq.ext.django.schema import *
    class Greeting(Document):
        author = StringProperty()
        content = StringProperty(required=True)
        date = DateTimeProperty(default=datetimee.utcnow)

and use it in your views.py :
        
    class GreetingForm(DocumentForm):
        
        class Meta:
            document = Greeting

    def home(request):
        
        greet = None
        
        if request.POST:
            form = GreetingForm(request.POST)
            if form.is_valid():
                greet = form.save()  
        else:
            form = GreetingForm()
            
        greetings = Greeting.view('greeting/all')
        
        return render("home.html", {
            "form": form,
            "greet": greet,
            "greetings": greetings
        }, context_instance=RequestContext(request)

You could notice in this example the `DocumentForm` object. 
This object works like the ModelForm object but for couchdb
documents. Very easy.

Views/shows/lists are created in _design folder of your application.
exemple :

    /yourapp
    /yourapp/_design
    /yourapp/_design/views
    /yourapp/_design/views/viewname
    /yourapp/_design/views/viewname/map.js
    ....

To create databases and sync views, just run the usual `syncdb` command.
It won't destroy your datas, just synchronize views.

from django.db.models import signals

def syncdb(app, created_models, verbosity=2, **kwargs):
    """ function used by syncdb signal """
    from couchdbreq.ext.django.loading import couchdbkit_handler
    couchdbkit_handler.sync(app, verbosity=verbosity)

signals.post_syncdb.connect(syncdb)
